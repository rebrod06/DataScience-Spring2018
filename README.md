# DataScience-Spring2018
A behind-the-scenes look into the coursework and final project for my Data Science class. You'll find Jupyter Notebooks showcasing:

- Extensive use of Pythonâ€™s Pandas library to import, clean and analyze datasets 
- Visualizations of datasets and analysis results
- Web data extraction using Beautiful Soup and APIs
- Applied knowledge of statistical techniques such as correlation, linear regression, logistic regression and A/B testing
- Implementation and evaluation of several machine learning models including:
  - Classification: k-nearest neighbors, SVM, decision trees, naive bayes
  - Clustering: k-means, hierarchical 
- Natural Language Processing and the use of a Naive Bayes classifier
